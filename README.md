# About Me
My name is Nirdesh Pokharel, I'm from Nepal. I am a high school graduate and I am currently working at a company called Truemark Technology.I'm a beginner web developer with mid-level knowledge of HTML and CSS, and a basic understanding of JavaScript. My experience at Truemark Technology has allowed me to gain valuable real-world experience in web development. These experiences have helped me develop my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am excited to continue growing as a developer.

My journey in web development started with a curiosity about how websites are built. I began learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and soon discovered the power of JavaScript. Although I still have much to learn, I am eager to continue improving my skills and building more complex and dynamic websites.

I believe that web development is not just about writing code, but also about understanding the user's needs and delivering an exceptional experience. That's why I always strive to create websites that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.
